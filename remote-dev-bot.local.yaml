# Self-dev config for remote-dev-bot developing itself.
#
# This file is the third config layer (base → override → local) and is
# only loaded when it exists in the target repo's root. It lives in the
# rdb repo so it applies when rdb is used to dev itself, but is NOT
# distributed to users via sparse-checkout (non-cone mode only fetches
# remote-dev-bot.yaml and lib/).
#
# Users CAN create their own remote-dev-bot.local.yaml; it will be
# applied as a third layer on top of their remote-dev-bot.yaml.

  # Show draft PRs for partial resolutions when devving rdb itself —
